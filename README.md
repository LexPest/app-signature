## app-signature
### Description
Provides the functionality for the hash generation from the specified input file (other words, generates a file signature). Hashes are generated block-by-block, blocks are separated by the specified size (in bytes). Outputs the signature in the specified output file.

### Requirements
* Compiler supporting the language version C++14
* CMake 3.12 and higher
  
### Build
1) Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/LexPest/app-signature```
2) Execute the following commands in the cloned repo root folder:
  ``` bash
  mkdir cmake-build
  cd cmake-build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build .
  ```
3) Launch command templates for the supported platforms are located in [\<repo\>/launch_examples](https://github.com/LexPest/app-signature/tree/master/launch_examples)

### Documentation
The project contains documentation generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).

Local documentation is available at [\<repo\>/docs/index.html](https://github.com/LexPest/app-signature/tree/master/docs/index.html).

Online documentation is available at [GitHub Pages](https://lexpest.github.io/app-signature/).

Doxygen configuration file for the project is located at the [\<repo\>/Doxyfile](https://github.com/LexPest/app-signature/blob/master/Doxyfile).

### Implementation details
* Program uses the multi-threading to optimize the generation time.
* Synchronization primitives used: mutexes, semaphores, conditional variables, atomics.
* Exceptions will be thrown if the error occurs (logical or argument).
* No raw pointers, RAII only.
* Arch contains OOP elements only.
* Generates a signature based on MD5.
* Both relative and absolute paths for arguments should be supported.
* Project doesn't rely on any of the *boost* dependencies.
